# esx_handcuffs-modified
Little bit modified version of esx_handcuffs
Original script https://github.com/scorpio686/esx_handcuffs
But modified to work better by ^Frans#0001 from https://discord.me/kuningasrp
I take no credits for making this because the real hero is scorpio686 for making the original files.
I maked it that way it adds automatically the items to shops but you can modify that from sql, prices are 10k per key on handcuffs.

INSTALLATION
1. Download the file
2. Drag the file to [esx] folder
3. After that add start esx_handcuffs to your server.cfg
4. Import the sql to your database
5. Restart your server and have fun
6. Prices are configurable from `shops` in your database
